# Generative-Adversarial-Network
Generative adversarial networks were invented by a researcher called Ian Goodfellow and he introduced GANs in 2014. GANs are very powerful. With the right data, network architecture and hyperparameters you could generate very realistic images. In the future, some advanced version of GANs or some other content generation algorithm will likely enable us to do cool stuff like: 1) Generate PhotoRealistic Video Games 2) Generate Movies. 3) Generate 3D designs for new technology(better cars,spaceships etc) How Gan will work : 1_sVjc6Btp70KlGaADhqqMeQ.jpeg Datasets of Human faces: 1)https://www.kaggle.com/gasgallo/faces-data-new 2)https://www.kaggle.com/gasgallo/lag-dataset Architecture of my Generative Adversariative Network : https://miro.medium.com/max/501/1*IoaJNDUC3a_kasLDKzHeKw.jpeg GAN will take the randomvalues as input and produce a real image.GAN is not one neural network.It is of two neural networks.They are- 1)Generator 2)Discriminator Generator will take the random values as input and produce a image.The generator generates images that are for humans indistinguishable from the real ones. Discriminator attempts to determine whether an image is fake or real.Discriminator network reaches an accuracy of 50%. In other words, discriminator cannot separate real and fake ones, so it has to guess each time.
